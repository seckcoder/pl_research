    ; Q: How the code runs?
    ; A: It implements an infinite loop. right-now returns the current continuation,
    ;    go-when makes the continuation returned as the result of continuation.
    ;    So when go-when called, it returns to the point of assigning result of `(right-now)
    ;    to `moment`. At the same time, moment is always continuation since it passes
    ;    continuation as argument(ie, return continuation as result of call/cc)
    (let ((moment (right-now)))
      (display "hello, world")
      (newline)
      (go-when moment))
